    * It is featured and fixed on all pages.

<summary>Index.html</summary>

<img src="assets\images\README-images\hero_slide3_readme.webp" alt="Description" width="300" height="200">

## Challenges

* I really wanted to have an animated slide show to grab the attention of the user. I tried using only CSS and HTML to manage it but I could not get it to work. So I resorted to using Chat GPT and JavaScript to pull it off.

<summary>Buy.html</summary>

## Main Feature
* A Grid layout to manage each advert, Shows a number of options in a grid with images, watch information, price and warranties.
* Each advert has a button that will direct to a form on contact.html to enquire about a watch this was because I did not know how to setup a shopping cart and thought this was the best option.

<img src="assets/images/README-images/buy.png" alt="Description">

## Challenges
* I initially tried using Flex Box but could not get the last row to align left and still maintain the column alignment, in research I found a guide on Grid managed the Ads much betterh easier. And when making it responsive it was easy to add media queries to reduce the columns when is was needed.

<summary>Contact.html</summary>

## Main Feature
* This is a form to provide information on contacting for a watch on the buy page. This could also later be added as another page on the Nav bar to allow customers to enquire on any watch that we could source for them. Not only on the available adverts. 
* Numerous questions using an array of inputs including radio, checkbox, Country and select
* On Submit will direct to thanks.html which is the form submit acknowledgment page


<img src="assets/images/README-images/contact.png" alt="Description">

## Challenges
* I had to come up with a way to finish the site without having the complexities of a shopping cart, I believed another form to allow users to enquire on adverts was a work around. A shopping cart could be added later on.
